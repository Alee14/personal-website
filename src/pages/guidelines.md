We enforce this nickname policy to keep a clean, friendly community.

This system is set in place so that the community is a nice place to be for everyone. When changing your nickname, it must comply with the following guidelines:

- No offensive words
- No symbols
- Do not change your nickname frequently
- Nicknames should not be attention-seeking (e.g. using a special characters to appear at the top of the list)

Users found to be in violation of these guidelines may have their nickname changed or lose the ability to change their nickname at the discretion of the staff.

## Threads/Posts

Threads/Posts is a new feature on Discord that allows users to create subchannels. To ensure that our community is not cluttered with low-value content, we have a policy against creating threads/posts with little to no value. If you create a thread/post that falls under this category, it will be considered spam and will be removed. If you are found to be repeatedly creating low-value threads/posts, you may lose the privilege to create them.

We recommend you to follow Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
